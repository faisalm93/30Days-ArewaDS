# 30Days of python learning @ Arewa Data Science Fellowship. 

This is a 30 days python learning exercise. I learn each day and below is the breakdown of the learning processess:-

Day_1 Introduction:- I learned simple arithmetics operations like addition,subtraction,multiplication,division, exponentials, modulus and floor division. I also learned Datatypes like int,float, and string.

Day_2 Variables_builtin_functions:- I learned proper variable convention, declaring multiple variables as well as checking data types and casting. I also learned about build in functions like print(), len(), type(), int(), float(), str(), input(), list(), dict(), min(), max(), sum(), sorted(), open(), file(), help(), and dir().

Day_3 Operators:- In day3, I learned operators like boolean, assignments,comparism,logical and arithmetics.

Day_4 Strings:- I learned how to create a string, format it, concatenate it, write string as a sequence of characters as well as methods in string.

Day_5 Lists:- I learned how to create a List, accessing list items using positive and negetive indexing, removing list using pop and del, copying,joining,counting and finding index of an item in a list.
