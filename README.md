# 30Days of python learning @ Arewa Data Science Fellowship. 

This is a 30 days python learning exercise. I learn each day and below is the breakdown of the learning processess:-

Day_1 Introduction:- I learned simple arithmetics operations like addition,subtraction,multiplication,division, exponentials, modulus and floor division. I also learned Datatypes like int,float, and string.

Day_2 Variables_builtin_functions:- I learned proper variable convention, declaring multiple variables as well as checking data types and casting. I also learned about build in functions like print(), len(), type(), int(), float(), str(), input(), list(), dict(), min(), max(), sum(), sorted(), open(), file(), help(), and dir().

Day_3 Operators:- In day3, I learned operators like boolean, assignments,comparism,logical and arithmetics.

Day_4 Strings:- I learned how to create a string, format it, concatenate it, write string as a sequence of characters as well as methods in string.

Day_5 Lists:- I learned how to create a List, accessing list items using positive and negetive indexing, removing list using pop and del, copying,joining,counting and finding index of an item in a list.

Day_6 Tuples:- I learned how to create a tupple, access its item, joining, deleting as well as changing tuples to list.

DAy_ 7Sets:- I learned how to create a set, getting its length, adding, removing, converting,joining, finding intersection,symmetric diffrences between two sets, as well as checking a subsets and superset.

Day_8 Dictionaries:- I learned how to create a dictionary, accessing dictionary items, add, delete,copy as well as  changing it to list. 

Day_9 Conditionals:- I learned how to create if, if else, if elif else if and or conditions as well as short hands and nested condition.

Day_10 Loops:- I learned how to create a loops which includes:- while,for,nested for and for else. i also learned range function.
